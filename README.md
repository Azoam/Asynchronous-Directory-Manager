# Asynchronous-Directory-Manager
Mimic file/directory changes onto a relative remote server.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Description
- Problem: Lots of people enjoy using their text editors on their local pc's and it's a
bit of a hassle to manage files/directories on remote servers.
- Possible Solution: A Asynchronous Manager that watches the directory being
worked on and whenever any changes happens within that directory (and sub directories)
and applies those changes to a relative remote directory; in a sense mimics.
